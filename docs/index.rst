   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Django CMS Timetravel's documentation!
=================================================

About django-cms-timetravel
---------------------------

Django CMS provides previewing of non-published pages. With preview an user can check a page before it goes online.
When configuring ``Homepage A`` with an expire date (for eg: 2013-03-04 00:00) and configuring ``Homepage B`` with a publish data (for eg: 2013-03-04 00:00) preview doesn't make the user feel safe about the homepage switch.

So how can a user check whether the new homepage switch will be picked up correctly?
That's where Django CMS Timetravel arrives at the scene!
